I am sure just by reading the heading of this post that many of you will put your war gear on and be ready to battle me on what I am about to write.  There are many views in the industry as to whether or not sizing is actually useful, possible, or uniform. I personally believe it *is* useful and possible and when I am done, hopefully you will understand how it can be uniform.

#### Sizing is not...
To understand sizing, it is helpful to understand what it is *not*. Then you will be better able to shape your understanding of what it actually is. 

##### An estimate of duration
One misunderstanding I have encountered is that size equals hours.  This produces a problem because it forces estimates to be in terms of absolutes.  E.g a task that is a "5" absolutely takes five hours.  Humans are not good at making absolute estimates that are precise, nor can we actually break down a construct to such a granular level. Add to that our imperfection (we forget things and have misunderstandings) and unforeseen occurrence, and you can see why working in absolutes never leads to a good ending.

##### A commitment
Another misunderstanding is the idea that a sized task is an immutable commitment. Sizing is an estimation. An estimation, by definition, is a rough or approximate calculation or judment. This means that your estimates can be wrong or can be impacted by outside influences, which affect the estimated values.  A commitment on the other hand, by definition, is an engagement, obligation, or pledge.  A commitment is not rough or approximate but exact.  An example is that you do not estimate when you pay your credit card bill but rather you are commited to paying on a certain day. When a commitment is not met there are associated penalties while an estimate comes with leniant learning.

##### Sizing is an amalgamation of...
Sizing is really about estimating *effort*, which is distinctly different from duration, and assigning it to a unit.  The estimating of size is *relative* to other sized units.  This usually works best using small sizing points, within one order of magnitude, as humans are not good with jugding long gaps nor large numbers. Sizing is also an amalgamation of thought and feeling processes.

##### Professional intuition
Through experience or calculated thought comes wisdom.  Professional developers are people who take their craft seriously, who consider the details or minutia of a problem, and who are passionate about their work.  When a professional views a problem through these "lenses", an intuitional light is produced. A gut feeling of how much effort is needed to accomplish a given task is usually what most professional developers start off considering when sizing.  This is not a long or involved process, but rather, following the law of diminishing returns, consideration is done to the point needed to obtain a gut feeling.

##### Comparison
Professional intuition can go a long way but not all the way.  That is why it is then important to consider past experiences (if available) or comparable abstractions when a professional has an opinion.  Take the opinion and compare it to other relative ideas and see if the opinion aligns or is off.  Either may happen and thats *ok*, as this is just another fine tuning process to estimating and it will produce conversation that gives insight.  This insight helps to narrow in on an accurate estimate of effort.

##### Deconstruction
If a professional cannot form an opinion or the opinion is so large in relation to any other comparible estimate, it may be that a unit of work is too large and needs to be deconstructed.  Earlier I mentioned using small points that are within one order of magnitude from another, and deconstructing will allow for that.  It gives the benefit of being able to compare small gaps and small numbers to be more accurate.  An example is that it is easier to be accurate when you estimate a 2 point story is twice as hard as a 1 point story, as the amount of effort between the two is within one order of magnitude. It is harder to be as accurate when you estimate a 100 point story is one hundred times harder than a 1 point story, as the difference between the two is so great. 

Hopefully this adds some clarity to those of you looking to increase your agile-foo in the area of sizing.
