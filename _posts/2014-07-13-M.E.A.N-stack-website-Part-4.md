title: M.E.A.N Stack Website - Part 4
---

In this post, part of an ongoing series in which I try to write some simple thoughts down on my experience developing a M.E.A.N. stack website, I am going to talk about [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) and what it did for me.

AngularJS is a [Google](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/goog) open source SPA (Single Page Application) framework. It truly is a *framework* in the sense that it does multiple things with a consistent theme, which is help build awesome client side apps. Since it is from Google and is open source, the [documentation guide](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide) is very expansive and great at getting started as well as covering advanced topics. There is also a *plethora* of videos on the web to get you [started](https://www.youtube.com/user/ngconfvideos?feature=watch) and an interactive [tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) to help you get started fast.

What I like about AngularJS so much is that testability is at the forefront of the design and documentation. You can clearly see [Misko Hevery](http://misko.hevery.com)'s hand in the creation or shaping of the product in this regard. (Check out his [Clean Code Talks](http://bit.ly/1zz7Lic), they are a great watch no matter what language you write in). 

In Javascript, as it is an interpreted language, you don't get the benefit of a static compiler to warn you of errors in your code during compilation. Rather, you get Javascript errors at *runtime*, which is NOT when you want errors to occur as they impact the user. Runtime errors can still occur with any language, but you get that little bit of extra confidence from the compilation step. Also, to guard against runtime errors, you write tests (Unit, Scenario, and Integration) to give you even more confidence.  Javascript relies heavily on testing to give confidence that your application will work in production as there is no compilation step.

With testing being so important, the AngularJS team helped the community out by releasing [Karma Runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/intro/how-it-works.html) which is a great test harness. And guess what, it has a GruntJS task plugin, so I/we can leverage our build tool that we talked about in the [last post](http://justintullgren.com/m-e-a-n-stack-website-part-3/) and get our tests to run on build. Oh, and did I mention there is a Yeoman AngularJS [Karma Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-karma) out there as well to scaffold out your test setup? Neat.

With Karma being a runner, or harness, it allows different testing libraries/frameworks to be used for unit testing your apps business logic in AngularJS. It comes with support for [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) and [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) out of box and has a simple api for adding more. What's nice about that is both of those frameworks work on the backend of a NodeJS stack as well, so you don't have to learn two different frameworks for unit testing.

I chose to use Mocha with [ChaiJS](http://chaijs.com) as I like Mocha's async testing and Chai's fluent assertions, which is a BDD (behavior driven design) syntax. I might switch back to Jasmine for my AngularJS business logic as I use it for my back end testing in NodeJS and I just learned that Jasmine supports spys which makes it a very powerful framework. It wraps up Mocha, Chai, and [SinonJS](http://sinonjs.org) very nicely, so if you want one library to learn, Jasmine is your choice.

The AngularJS team also released an E2E testing framework on Karma and then moved it into a final product called [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor). Protractor uses [Selenium](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/) as a driver (a way of moving through the browser) to allow you to write integration tests for your app. Protractor, just like Karma has a GruntJS plugin and uses the same testing framework Jasmine. It is beginning to become obvious that testing is at the forefront of the AngularJS vision as the testing from bottom up or top down is seamless and flows very well.

I won't get into too much AngularJS as there is a ton on the web, as I have shown, but here area few tips I highly recommend. 

When writing your AngularJS logic, always use the string literal dependency injection method, so that you can minify your code without it breaking.
`angular.module('myApp')
  .controller('ctrl',/*begin dependency injection*/['$scope', 'dependency2', function($scope, dependency2){$scope.items = dependency2.get();//$scope and dependency2 will get minified, but still work
  }]);`

One thing to know about this though, is that if you are making a service/factory that has no dependencies, the bracket array notation will throw an error as it assumes your service function is a dependency and tries to find it, so don't use that syntax until you have dependencies.

Also, I disagree with the default MVC folder structure that most AngularJS scaffolds start you with, which is a folder for views with a sub directory for directives, and a folder for all controllers. I prefer that each unit be in its own app, such as a nav app, that has the view(s), controller, any specific service/factory, and all the tests.  This simplifies file naming and finding related units of code.

`
.
+--Apps/
|  +--Nav/
|    +--view.html
|    +--controller.js
|    +--controller_spec.js
|    +--service.js
|    +--service_spec.js
.
`


I will wrap this long post up with those two tips. Thank you very much for reading.  See you next week!
