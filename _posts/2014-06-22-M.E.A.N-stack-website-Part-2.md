This is the second post in a series about what I have gleaned from building a NodeJS M.E.A.N website.  The [previous article](http://justintullgren.com/m-e-a-n-stack-website-part-1/) outlined the reasons I chose to use the aforementioned stack. In this post, I would like explain how I got started.

### Installation... Or not

Let me start off by saying that though installation is super simple, I did end up going off on many tangents that slowed me down. I watched all the videos I could find, and each one introduced a new concept or tool that made me want to know more. Such as [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), [Brew Cask](http://caskroom.io/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/), and [Bower](http://bower.io/) for package management, and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for an I.D.E.  I also saw development workflow tricks from known Google Devs, like [Paul Irish](http://www.paulirish.com/) and [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/blog/) which made me want to go set up the same way (check out [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/)). In this paragraph alone, I have shown but a few of the cool things happening out there in the open source community and from Google which took me down so many paths... away from installation.

### Installation
You have a couple of options: head over to [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and click install, which installs the node binaries, npm, and sets up paths. I actually had problems with this method as I continually had to go install again due to upgrades (of node and npm or mac updates) which required sudo, or the paths would change or I would need to retake ownership of items. 

That being said, [Isaac Z. Schlueter, @izs](https://twitter.com/izs) has a wonderful [gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install in under 30 seconds.  I mentioned Homebrew before, so naturally I chose the homebrew method in the gist.

### Getting Started
In .Net, Visual Studio comes with a few scaffolded out templates, such as their WebApi Projects, an MVC project with Razor, etc.  In NodeJS world, there is a great scaffolding engine called [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/); install it with `npm install -g yo` and then get this M.E.A.N stack [generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) by running `npm install -g generator-angular-fullstack` (generator is a yeoman term for a scaffolding engine). Now we have a nice scaffolding system that we can use to quickly create new sites with all the community best practices followed, just like in Visual Studio. I recommend browsing the official yeoman generators and the community ones as well.  There are a lot, and they are all great resources of seeing how things are done.

Now we have a site scaffolding engine, but since this is a M.E.A.N. stack, we also need [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/). I used the homebrew install, which sets up MongoDB to run on system start up.

Next create a site directory `mkdir mywww`, cd in, and run `yo` (which is the yoeman scaffolding engine). You will be presented with options such as upgrading and installing a generator. Select `Run the Angular-fullstack generator` and follow the prompts. Since this was a learning experience for me, I chose them all. 

After you select all your options, npm will download the internet (jk), and you will get a nice message saying if successful or not.  Run `grunt serve` and the build process will kick off and you should now have a nice example M.E.A.N. stack site all ready to go, running in your browser.

Since this post is getting wordy, I will pick up in my next post by going over [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/), which we used to start the site, and dissecting the Gruntfile.js. 

Thanks for reading!
